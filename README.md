SoulSync - Reconnect People Through Meaningful Interactions

🌍 Why This Project?

In today's digital world, we are more connected than ever, yet loneliness is a growing issue. Social and dating apps often focus on endless swiping, paid subscriptions, and surface-level interactions rather than fostering real, meaningful connections.

SoulSync is an open-source platform designed to help people reconnect through genuine interactions, whether for friendship or deeper connections. We believe technology should bring people together, not keep them glued to their screens.

🎯 What is SoulSync?

SoulSync is an ethical, non-commercial social platform aimed at fostering authentic relationships based on personality, values, and meaningful discussions, rather than appearance. Unlike traditional apps, it encourages users to engage in real conversations and meet in person rather than endlessly scrolling.

🔥 Key Features

Personality-Based Matching → Meet people based on shared values, not just profile pictures.

No Swiping, No Ads, No Premium Tiers → Everyone has the same experience, without artificial engagement traps.

Guided Icebreaker Questions → Thought-provoking prompts to kickstart conversations.

Local Events & Meetups → Encouraging real-life interactions through free local activities.

Limited Screen Time → Designed to get people OFF the app and into real connections.
